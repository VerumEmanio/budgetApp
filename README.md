# budgetApp
<b>Background</b><br>
A modular, secure [browser-based budget app](https://verumemanio.github.io/budgetApp/) that calculates your remaining budget for the month based on the income and expenses you list. Each expense item also displays its percent of the current total income. I wrote all of the JavaScript, but the HTML and CSS were provided by a Udemy course. I wrote the app in ES5, but I plan to rewrite it in ES6 to get more practice with ES6 syntax.

<b>How to use the app</b><br>
• To add a transaction, select either + or -, write a transaction description, specify the amount, and then click the check box.<br>
• To remove a transaction by clicking the x that appears when you hover to the right of an item's value.

<b>Known bugs</b>
• The percent listed in the total expenses box will sometimes display 0% after an expense is removed from the list.
