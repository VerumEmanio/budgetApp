# budgetApp
A modular browser-based budget app. I wrote all of the JavaScript, but the HTML and CSS were provided by a Udemy course. The instructions were as follows:
<br>• All data should be contained in modules so it remains private.
<br>• The user can add a transaction to the income or expense category by clicking the check box. Each item has a + or - sign, a description of the transaction, and a # value.
<br>• Once the user clicks the checkmark button, the income or expense bar at the top of the screen adjust accordingly, and the transaction is added to either the income or expense column.
<br>• The user should be able to remove a transaction by clicking the x that appears when they hover to the right of the item's value.
<br>• Each expense item should also display what percentage it is of the total income.
